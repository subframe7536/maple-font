## Build

Clone the repo and run on your local machine. Make sure you have `python3` and `pip` installed

```shell
git clone https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font --depth 1 -b variable
pip install foundrytools-cli
python build.py
```

- For `Ubuntu` or `Debian`, maybe `python-is-python3` is needed as well

If you have trouble installing the dependencies, just create a new Github codespace on `variable` branch and run the commands there

### Customize

You can change build config in `config.json`

- There is `--normal` option in `build.py` for common config, just like `JetBrains Mono` (with slashed zero)
- For custom `font-patcher` args, `font-forge` (and maybe `python3-fontforge` as well) is needed


#### Font Feature Freeze Options

- `enable`: Move ligature rules to `calt`, which will enable the features without setting up `cvXX` / `ssXX` / `zero` in font features config, just as default ligatures
- `disable`: Remove the features in `cvXX` / `ssXX` / `zero`, which will no longer effect, even if you enable it manually
- `ignore`: Do nothing

### Chinese version

1. Download CN base font at [Gitee release](https://gitee.com/subframe7536/Maple/releases/tag/v7.0-beta23)
2. Put them into `./source/cn`
3. Run `build.py` and **BE PATIENT**, instantiation will take about 40-50 minutes

#### Notice

The build script will auto download neccessory assets from GitHub. If you have trouble downloading, setup `github_mirror` in `config.json` or `$GITHUB` to your environment variable.
