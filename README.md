# Maple Mono

Maple Mono is an open source monospace font focused on smoothing your coding flow.

I create it to enhance my working experience, and hope that it can be useful to others.

V7 is a completely remade version, providing variable font, redesigning more than half of the glyphs and offering smarter ligatures. You can checkout V6 [here](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font/tree/main)

## Features

- ✨ Variable - Infinity font weights with fine-grained italic glyphs.
- ☁️ Smooth - Round corner, brand-new glyph of `@ $ % & Q ->` and cursive `f i j k l x y` in italic style.
- 💪 Useful - Large amount of smart ligatures, see in [`features/`](./source/features/README.md)
- 🎨 Icon - First-Class [Nerd-Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) support, make your terminal more vivid.
- 🔨 Customize - Enable or disable font features as you want, just make your own font.

### Simpified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Japanese

The CN version contails the glyphs of simplified and traditional Chinese, and Japanese, which are not as normal as most CN fonts. The CJK glyphs' spacing is much looser for better metric alignment, see details in [release notes](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font/releases/tag/cn-base) and [this issue](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font/issues/211).

### Arch Linux

```

## Naming FAQ

### Features

- **Ligature**: Default version with ligatures (`Maple Mono`)
- **No-Ligature**: Default version without ligatures (`Maple Mono NL`)
- **Normal-Ligature**: [`--normal` preset](#preset) with ligatures (`Maple Mono Normal`)
- **Normal-No-Ligature**: [`--normal` preset](#preset) without ligatures (`Maple Mono Normal NL`)

### Format and Glyph Set

- **Variable**: Minimal version, smoothly change font weight by variable
- **TTF**: Minimal version, ttf format [Recommend!]
- **OTF**: Minimal version, otf format
- **WOFF2**: Minimal version, woff2 format, for small size on web pages
- **NF**: Nerd-Font patched version, add icons for terminal (With `-NF` suffix)
- **CN**: Chinese version, embed with Chinese and Japanese glyphs (With `-CN` suffix)
- **NF-CN**: Full version, embed with icons, Chinese and Japanese glyphs (With `-NF-CN` suffix)

### Font Hint

- **Hinted font** is used for low resolution screen to have better render effect. From my experience, if your screen resolution is lower or equal than 1080P, it is recommended to use "hinted font". Using "unhinted font" will lead to misalignment or uneven thickness on your text.
  - In this case, you can choose `MapleMono-TTF-AutoHint` / `MapleMono-NF` / `MapleMono-NF-CN`, etc.
- **Unhinted font** is used for high resolution screen (e.g. for MacBook). Using "hinted font" will blur your text or make it looks weird.
  - In this case, you can choose `MapleMono-OTF` / `MapleMono-TTF` / `MapleMono-NF-unhinted` / `MapleMono-NF-CN-unhinted`, etc.
- Why there exists `-AutoHint` and `-unhinted` suffix?
  - for backward compatibility, I keep the original naming scheme. `-AutoHint` is only used for `TTF` format.

## Custom Build

The [`config.json`](./config.json) file is used to configure the build process. Checkout the [schema](./source/schema.json) or [document](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font/blob/variable/source/features/README.md) for more details.

There also have some [command line options](#build-script-usage) for customizing the build process. Cli options have higher priority than options in `config.json`.

### Use Github Actions

You can use [Github Actions](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font/actions/workflows/custom.yml) to build the font.

1. Fork the repo
2. (Optional) Change the content in `config.json`
3. Go to Actions tab
4. Click on `Custom Build` menu item on the left
5. Click on `Run workflow` button with options setup
6. Wait for the build to finish
7. Download the font archives from Releases

### Use Docker

```shell
git clone https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font --depth 1 -b variable
docker build -t maple-font .
docker run -v "$(pwd)/fonts:/app/fonts" -e BUILD_ARGS="--normal" maple-font
```

### Local Build

Clone the repo and run on your local machine. Make sure you have `python3` and `pip` installed

```shell
git clone https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font --depth 1 -b variable
pip install -r requirements.txt
python build.py
```

- For `Ubuntu` or `Debian`, maybe `python-is-python3` is needed as well

If you have trouble installing the dependencies, just create a new GitHub Codespace and run the commands there

#### Custom Nerd-Font

For custom `font-patcher` args, `font-forge` (and maybe `python3-fontforge` as well) is required.

Maybe you should also change `"nerd_font.extra_args"` in [config.json](./config.json)

#### Preset

Add `--normal` flag in `build.py` for common config, make the font just like `JetBrains Mono` (with slashed zero).

#### Font Feature Freeze

There are three kind of options for feature freeze:

1. `enable`: Move ligature rules to `calt`, which will enable the features without setting up `cvXX` / `ssXX` / `zero` in font features config, just as default ligatures
2. `disable`: Remove the features in `cvXX` / `ssXX` / `zero`, which will no longer effect, even if you enable it manually
3. `ignore`: Do nothing

#### Load Custom Feature File

Run `build.py` with `--apply-fea-file` flag, the feature file from [`source/features/{regular,italic}.fea`](./source/features) will be applied into variable font. You can modify it to change all features, e.g. remove some ligatures in `calt`.

### Chinese version

Run `python build.py --cn`, the CN base fonts (about 130 MB) will download from GitHub.

If you want to build CN base fonts from variable (about 35 MB), setup `"cn.use_static_base_font": false` in [config.json](./config.json) and **BE PATIENT**, instantiation will take about 40-50 minutes.

#### GitHub Mirror

The build script will auto download necessary assets from GitHub. If you have trouble downloading, please setup `github_mirror` in [config.json](./config.json) or `$GITHUB` to your environment variable. (Target URL will be `https://{github_mirror}/<user>/<repo>/releases/download/{tag}/{file}`), or just download the target `.zip` file and put it in the same directory as `build.py`.

### Build Script Usage

```
usage: build.py [-h] [-v] [-d] [--debug] [-n] [--feat FEAT] [--apply-fea-file]
                [--hinted | --no-hinted] [--liga | --no-liga] [--cn-narrow]
